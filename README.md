# Qunatum-random-number-generator
This is Pyhton programm which uses Google's Cirq and quantum computer to generate a random number. There are 4 qubits involved in this project. We put them in superposition using Hadamard gate (--H--) in each qubit then measure each of them getting 2-bit number like "0101" which we convert into 10-bit numbers like "0101"=5.
